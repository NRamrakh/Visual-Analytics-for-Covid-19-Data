# Impact of diet of people and the restrictive measures during the Covid-19 pandemic

## Description :

We intend to work with three different datasets of Covid-19 pandemic. We will visualize how the distinctive measures executed by the governments of diverse countries helped control the pandemic. Also, we will visualize how the diet and nutrition of the affected individuals played a role in the recovery and death due to Covid-19.

We chose these datasets because we want to visualize how different factors like restrictions within the country and the people's diet affected the number of covid cases. The entire world is affected by Covid-19, and it is difficult to assess the condition of each country by just looking at the numbers. Therefore, we need to represent this data with the visual analytics methodology and get interactive visualization to enhance the userâ€™s knowledge.


## Datasets:

We will be using the following datasets:

1)This dataset contains the data of all the measures taken by governments of different countries to control the pandemic: https://www.acaps.org/covid-19-government-measures-dataset

2) This dataset contains the real time data of covid-19 cases country wise : https://www.kaggle.com/gauravduttakiit/covid-19

3) This dataset contains Covid-19 healthy diet dataset country wise: https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset


## Target Users and Tasks: 

Target Users: Our target users are common People

## Tasks:

1) How did different measures taken by different countries to control the Pandemic impact the total number of Covid-19 cases over the time?

2) What is the impact of vegan diet and non-vegan diet on the recovered cases and deaths in different countries?

3) What is the correlation between nutrients consumed by recovered people in different countries?

4) What is the correlation between the health of people, number of covid cases, deaths and recovered cases of different countries?

## We are going to visualize these tasks in Tableau. These jams are the visual representation of how these tasks might look like.
